Metwalli 15 hours ago·5 min read As a student, who has been in school almost my entire life, I always felt that the knowledge we learn in school is theoretical. That feeling only grew whenever I talked to my friends and colleagues who worked in the industry or had some experiences outside the university. This gap between what we learn in our degrees and what we actually need to succeed and build a career is one of the reasons internships are necessary for any student. Although internships are important for basically any student regardless of their major, it’s even more important if you’re a student in a tech field. In tech, we study the history of a field, the tools we can use, and some field applications. But, university classes are never enough to build a real-life experience that will help you launch a career once you graduate. Here, internships make a difference, not just helping students gain experience and know what to expect when they get a job after graduation. Still, it also helps them decide what career they want to pursue after obtaining their degree. So, if you’re a student, undergrad or post-grad, trying to get an internship, it will definitely change the way you view your field and help you get a job later. towardsdatascience.com In September of every year, companies worldwide open up the applications for the following year’s summer.

Takeaways No matter what degree you go to school for, there is always a gap between what we learn in the university and what we will actually do after we graduate and start looking for jobs. Not just that, but often, after we graduate and start going through the job-hunting nightmare — you better start if before you graduate, though — we realize that we don’t even have the experience needed for an entire level position. towardsdatascience.com Thankfully, we can gain the experience we need and make some money in the process by trying to obtain an internship in a company. Often most companies open up chances for internships during the summer vacation, and applying for these internships opens during the fall of the year before. So, basically, now is the ideal time to start looking and applying for next year’s summer internships.
